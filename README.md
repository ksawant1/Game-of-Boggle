# Game-of-Boggle
Boggle is one of the most popular word search games and is played on a N x N board made of cubes with letters printed on it.
We provide a manual dictionary and try to construct words on the board following these rules:
i. Can move from one letter to another if it is a neighbour (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.).
ii. A word must be 3 or more letters long to be valid

In this problem, we are constructing a game of boggle by applying three search strategies binary search, brute force and trie
Our main aim is to find out which search strategy will be most efficient and fast in finding the word. We will compare our search strategies with one another based on number of inputs, time to search the string and performance
